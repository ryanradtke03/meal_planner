# Documentation

Welcome to the Meal Planner documentation.

This folder contains high-level system documentation to ensure architecture, API contracts, and development practices evolve alongside features.

## Contents

- [Architecture](./architecture.md)
- [API](./api.md)
- [Auth Endpoints](./auth.md)
- [Web App](./web.md)
- [Database](./db.md)
- [Contributing](./contributing.md)

## Philosophy

Documentation should:
- Explain *why* decisions were made
- Clarify system boundaries
- Prevent knowledge loss
- Stay lightweight and practical

When adding major features, update the relevant doc.
